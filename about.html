                        <h3 style="color: #0299B3; margin-bottom: 24px;">An operator who coaches, not a coach who read about operations.</h3>
                        
                        <p>
                            I help founder-CEOs of 5-75 person companies build the operational foundations and leadership capacity they need to scale without burning out or losing their vision.

                        <p>
                            After 20+ years working everywhere from bootstrapped startups to Fortune 50 boardrooms, I've learned this: most operational problems aren't what they appear to be. You don't need another framework or motivational speech. You need someone who can diagnose what's actually broken—and knows how to fix it because they've done it before.
                        </p>

                    <h2>The Long Version</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        I've been the person founders call when everything they've tried hasn't worked. When the new software didn't solve it. When hiring more people made it worse. When every "solution" just moved the problem somewhere else.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That's because most business problems are symptoms, not root causes. And if you're treating symptoms, you're just playing operational whack-a-mole—exhausting yourself while the real issues compound in the background.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Why I Do This Work</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        I've sat in your seat. I've been the CEO of a bootstrapped company, the COO cleaning up operational chaos, the Chief of Staff translating between vision and execution. I've built systems from scratch for startups and refined them at Fortune 50 scale.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        What I learned: <strong>founders don't need to stop being CEO to scale their companies.</strong> They need operational foundations that actually work—and someone who can help them build leadership capacity while they're still in the seat.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Most coaches haven't operated at scale. Most operators haven't coached founders. I do both, which means I can meet you where you are—whether you're fighting fires or ready to think strategically—and build with you, not just tell you what to do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I live in Chicago with my two daughters. I'm a digital crisis counselor volunteer with The Trevor Project, providing overnight crisis support to LGBTQ+ youth. I believe in authenticity, integrity, and doing hard things with compassion.

                        I'm an AI-native consultant—not because it's trendy, but because it makes me better at the work. I use AI to process context, identify patterns, and deliver insights faster, while keeping human judgment, empathy, and strategic thinking at the center.
                    </p>

                        The Motherlode name? It's a double easter egg: the Sims cheat code for instant resources (because good operations give you time and capacity), and the mining term for hitting the jackpot (because diagnosing root causes instead of treating symptoms is where the real value lives).
                    </p>

                        The logo's Konami code circles? That's for the founders who get it. ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA.

                        If this resonates, let's talk. I work with founder-CEOs who are ready to diagnose what's actually broken and build systems that stick.
