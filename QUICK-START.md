## 💡 TIPS

**Testing Locally:**
- Just open index.html in your browser
- No server needed for local preview
- Some features (forms) won't work until deployed

**Finding Insertion Points:**
- Search HTML files for "INSERTION POINT"
- Clear comments mark where to add code
- Example: "CALENDLY INLINE WIDGET INSERTION POINT"

**Getting Help:**
- Check INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md first
- Look for inline comments in code
- Browser console (F12) shows errors

**Common Issues:**
- Logo not showing? Check filename spelling exactly
- Particles not moving? Clear browser cache
- Mobile menu stuck? Check main.js is loading
